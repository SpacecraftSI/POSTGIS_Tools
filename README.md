# POSTGIS_Tools
Evolution of the 'posting' tools from 2023. The hope here is to make them a bit more flexible/modular. 

See local_config_EXAMPLE.py for example of configuration for local database. Create file called local_config.py using that template.

Dependancies:
- PostgreSQL Database w/ POSTGIS extension. 
- Psycopg2
